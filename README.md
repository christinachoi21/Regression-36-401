# Regression-36-401

This course is an introduction to applied data analysis. We will explore data sets, examine various
models for the data, assess the validity of their assumptions, and determine which conclusions we
can make (if any). Data analysis is a bit of an art; there may be several valid approaches. We will
strongly emphasize the importance of critical thinking about the data and the question of interest.
Our overall goal is to use a basic set of modeling tools to explore and analyze data and to present
the results in a scientific report.

The course includes a review and discussion of exploratory methods, informal techniques for
summarizing and viewing data. We then consider simple linear regression, a model that uses only
one predictor. After briefly reviewing some linear algebra, we turn to multiple linear regression,
a model that uses multiple variables to predict the response of interest. For all models, we will
examine the underlying assumptions. More specifically, do the data support the assumptions? Do
they contradict them? What are the consequences for inference? Finally, we will explore extra
topics such as, for example, generalized linear models, additive models, nonparametric regression,
and high-dimensional regression.
